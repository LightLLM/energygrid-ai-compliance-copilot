# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### Q: What is EnergyGrid.AI Compliance Copilot?

**A:** EnergyGrid.AI Compliance Copilot is an AI-powered compliance management system designed specifically for energy sector organizations. It automates the process of regulatory compliance by intelligently processing PDF documents, extracting compliance obligations, generating audit tasks, and creating comprehensive compliance reports.

### Q: What types of documents can the system process?

**A:** The system currently supports PDF documents up to 50MB in size. It can process various types of regulatory documents including:
- Federal and state energy regulations
- Utility commission orders
- NERC standards
- Environmental compliance requirements
- Safety regulations
- Grid reliability standards

### Q: How accurate is the AI-powered obligation extraction?

**A:** The system uses Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3 Sonnet, which provides high accuracy for text analysis. Typical accuracy rates are:
- **95%+** for clearly written regulatory text
- **90%+** for complex technical documents
- **85%+** for scanned or image-based PDFs

Each extracted obligation includes a confidence score to help you assess the reliability of the extraction.

### Q: What AWS regions are supported?

Currently tested regions include: us-east-1, us-west-2, eu-west-1.

## Technical Questions

### Q: What are the system requirements for deployment?

**A:** To deploy EnergyGrid.AI, you need:
- AWS CLI v2.0+
- SAM CLI v1.100+
- Python 3.11+
- AWS account with appropriate permissions
- Access to Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet model)

### Q: How long does document processing take?

**A:** Processing times vary based on document size and complexity:
- **Small documents** (1-10 pages): 2-5 minutes
- **Medium documents** (10-50 pages): 5-15 minutes
- **Large documents** (50+ pages): 15-30 minutes

The system processes documents asynchronously, so you can upload multiple documents and track their progress.

### Q: Can I customize the obligation extraction prompts?

**A:** Yes, the system allows customization of AI prompts. You can modify the prompts in the analyzer module to:
- Focus on specific types of obligations
- Adjust categorization criteria
- Include industry-specific terminology

### Q: How does the system handle different document formats?

**A:** The system uses multiple extraction methods:
1. **PyPDF2**: For standard PDF text extraction
2. **pdfplumber**: For complex layouts and tables
3. **OCR fallback**: For scanned documents (planned feature)

If one method fails, the system automatically tries alternative approaches.

### Q: What happens if document processing fails?

**A:** The system has robust error handling:
- Failed documents are sent to dead letter queues
- Detailed error logs are available in CloudWatch
- Users receive notifications about processing failures
- Documents can be reprocessed after fixing issues
- Manual intervention options are available

## Security and Compliance

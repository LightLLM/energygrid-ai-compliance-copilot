# Requirements Document

## Introduction

EnergyGrid.AI is an AI-powered compliance copilot designed to streamline regulatory compliance management for energy sector organizations. The system enables users to upload PDF regulations, automatically extract compliance obligations, plan audit tasks, and generate comprehensive compliance reports. The platform leverages AWS services including Lambda, API Gateway, Bedrock, S3, DynamoDB, and Cognito to provide a scalable, secure, and intelligent compliance management solution.

3. WHEN tasks are generated THEN the system SHALL assign appropriate resources and deadlines
4. WHEN task planning is complete THEN the system SHALL store tasks in DynamoDB with status tracking
5. IF task generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback manual task creation options
6. WHEN tasks are created THEN the system SHALL enable task assignment and progress tracking

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to generate comprehensive compliance reports, so that I can demonstrate regulatory adherence to auditors and stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a report THEN the Reporter Agent SHALL compile data from obligations and tasks
2. WHEN report generation starts THEN the system SHALL allow selection of date ranges and obligation types
3. WHEN data compilation is complete THEN the system SHALL generate formatted reports in PDF format
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in S3 with access controls
5. IF report generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide error details and retry mechanisms
6. WHEN reports are ready THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide download links

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure user authentication and authorization, so that only authorized personnel can access compliance data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access the system THEN Cognito SHALL authenticate their credentials
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL establish a secure session with appropriate permissions
3. WHEN users access resources THEN the system SHALL verify authorization for each operation
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
5. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
6. WHEN users are created THEN the system SHALL enforce strong password policies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want an intuitive web interface, so that I can easily manage documents, tasks, and reports without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the application THEN Streamlit SHALL provide a responsive web interface
2. WHEN users navigate the interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear menu options and workflows
3. WHEN users perform actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and status updates
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with guidance
5. WHEN data loads THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators for long-running operations
6. WHEN users interact with forms THEN the system SHALL validate inputs in real-time

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment and infrastructure management, so that the system can be deployed consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is initiated THEN SAM SHALL provision all required AWS resources automatically
2. WHEN infrastructure changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain environment consistency
3. WHEN deployments complete THEN the system SHALL verify all services are operational
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and preserve data integrity
5. WHEN monitoring is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide health checks and alerting
6. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust resources based on demand

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want real-time processing status and notifications, so that I can track document processing and task completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria
